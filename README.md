## How I handle the admin panel configuration?

I decided to use Auth0 that already have components that works with and for authentication, so I can use their log in form for my authorized users, in that way they can access the admin panel and add or edit content on the webapp.

## Light and Dark Theme

With this project I did deeper research about light theme and dark theme implementations and design fundamentals about them. The article that helped me the most was this one [Material Design](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html). I did read another articles about it but this one was the better in my opinion.
